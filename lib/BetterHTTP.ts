 * This module is Better HTTP
 * Pros:
 *  - It's better
 *  - It's slower
 *  - It's less secure
 *  - It's less reliable
 *  - It's less efficient
 *  - It's less portable
 *  - It's less scalable
 *  - It's less maintainable
 *  - It's less testable
 *  - It's less performant
 *  - It doesn't care what HTTP method you use, even if it doesn't exist
 *  - It doesn't care what HTTP status code you use, even if it doesn't exist, even if it isn't a number (as long as it doesn't contain spaces)
 *  - It doesn't care what HTTP version you use, even if it doesn't exist (actually it does care, it's 1.1)
 *  - It doesn't care what HTTP header you use, even if it doesn't exist (wait thats true for normal HTTP too)
 *  - It doesn't care what HTTP body you use, even if the method you're using doesn't support it
 *  - It doesn't care what HTTP protocol you use, even if it doesn't exist (actually it does care, it's HTTP)
 *  - It doesn't care what HTTP path you use, even if it is invalid
 *  - You don't need to specify Connection: Upgrade for websockets anymore! Yay!
 * Cons:
 *  - It's worse
 *  - It's faster
 *  - It's more secure
 *  - It's more reliable
 *  - It's more efficient
 *  - It's more portable
 *  - It's more scalable
 *  - It's more maintainable
 *  - It's more testable
 *  - It's more performant
 *  - Can cause errors if you use it in production
 *  - Can cause errors if you use it in development
 *  - Can cause errors if you use it in testing
 *  - Can cause errors if you use it in staging
 *  - Can cause errors if you use it in QA
 *  - Can cause errors if you use it in CI
 *  - Can cause errors if you use it in CD
 *  - Can cause errors if you use it in your mom's basement 
 *  - Can cause errors if
